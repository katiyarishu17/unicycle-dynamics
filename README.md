The supplementary material for analyzing and modeling the simplified unicycle system is given here. The symbolic calculations for the dynamic system have been carried out in Maple to find the governing equations for the dynamic system. This maple file includes all the substitutions, simplifications, and approximations made to derive the final forms of the equations.

Unicycle modeling is done in Fusion 360 to provide a realistic visual representation of the system we are studying. The model is included in the files for this project and can also be found at [this](https://a360.co/3Ow2lPZ) link.

The numerical simulations for control characteristics implemented for this system are carried out in Matlab. The angle and position coordinates are exported and used in Blender to create the animation.
